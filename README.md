## message
```
thinkpad nginx: { "timestamp": "2019-09-07T13:46:01+04:30", "remote_addr": "192.168.43.174", "body_bytes_sent": 0, "request_time": 0.000, "response_status": 304, "request": "GET / HTTP/1.1", "request_method": "GET", "host": "192.168.43.174","upstream_cache_status": "","upstream_addr": "","http_x_forwarded_for": "","http_referrer": "", "http_user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:69.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/69.0" }
```
